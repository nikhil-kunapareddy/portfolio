# About Me
I am a graduate student at Northeastern University, currently pursuing a master’s degree in Data Science. Prior to this, I worked for three years at Zahnradfabrik's Research and Development Center, eventually leaving as a Senior Computational Engineer. My role primarily involved building computational models for prediction and simulation.

During my time there, I had the opportunity to delve into programming, particularly in creating workflow automations and mathematical modeling using Monte Carlo simulations and Wohler curves. Most importantly, I conducted research on the application of machine learning in computational science, focusing on material classification, topology optimization, and failure detection. This experience greatly motivated me to pursue a master’s degree in machine learning.

After completing my degree, I hope to join the industry as a machine learning engineer with a focus on deep learning. I am also interested in physics-informed neural networks, game theory, solid and fluid mechanics. Outside of science and technology, I follow chess, European football, and filmmaking.
